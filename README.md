Banking System Code using OOP

The following code includes three main classes: Account, Person and Services

The CheckingAccount class and SavingsAccount class will each inherit from the original Account class.

The Employee and Customer classes will inherit from the Person class.

Hizonhood, CreditCard and Loan classes will all inherit from the Service class.

The Person class can work with the each account or service via the visit_bank() method or use_service() method.

What needs to be completed later on are storing all of the data collected through either a SQL database 
or JSON object storage.
